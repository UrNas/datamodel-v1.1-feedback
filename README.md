# Datamodel v1.1

## Motivation

Over the last months, we have worked with the community to define a new [datamodel specification](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3408) for Prisma. This new version is called datamodel v1.1.

The main motivations for the new datamodel are:

- Enabling more control over how Prisma lays out the database schema
- Consolidated migrations (unifying the "active" and "passive" database connectors)

### More control over database layout

The current datamodel is opinionated about the database layout in many ways. Here are a few things that are now possible with datamodel v1.1:

- Model/field names in the datamodel can differ from the names of the underlying tables/columns
- Specify whether a relation should use a JOIN table or inline references
- Use any field as `id` field
- Use any field as `createdAt` or `updatedAt` fields

### Consolidated migrations

With the current datamodel, developers need to decide whether Prisma should perform database migrations for them, by setting the `migrations` flag in [`PRISMA_CONFIG`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-server/deployment-environments/docker-rty1/#prisma_config-reference) when the Prisma server is deployed. In datamodel v1.1 the `migrations` flag is removed, meaning developers can at all times either migrate the database manually or use Prisma for the migration.

## Getting started with the datamodel v1.1

### Prerequisites

The datamodel v1.1 is available in the [latest beta](https://www.prisma.io/docs/releases-and-maintenance/releases-and-beta-access/installing-the-beta-b5op/) version of Prisma.

#### 1. Install the latest beta of the Prisma CLI

```
npm install -g prisma@beta
```

#### 2. Use the latest beta Prisma Docker image

In the Docker Compose file for your Prisma server, make sure to use the latest beta Docker image:

```yml
prismagraphql/prisma:1.30-beta
```

#### 3. Set the `prototype` flag to `true` in `PRISMA_CONFIG`

Enable the datamodel v1.1 by adding the `prototype` flag in your [`PRISMA_CONFIG`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-server/deployment-environments/docker-rty1/#prisma_config-reference):

```yml
port: 4466
prototype: true
databases:
  default:
    connector: postgres # or mysql
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
    user: prisma
    password: prisma
```

> Note that you might need to adjust the database connection details to match your setup. Check out the [`example`](./example) folder for a ready-to-use setup.

TBD

### `id`

TBD

### `createdAt` & `updatedAt`

TBD

## Migrations and introspection with the Prisma CLI

### `prisma deploy`

The command `prisma deploy` got enhanced. From now on, there will be two modes that allow developers to choose whether the Prisma migration system should migrate their database:

- `prisma deploy`: This command reads your datamodel and migrates the underlying database to match it.
- `prisma deploy --no-migrate`: This command does *not* migrate the underlying database. Instead, it expects the database schema to be in the right state already (which means you need to manually migrate the database _before_ running `prisma deploy --no-migrate`)! If the datamodel and database schema do not align, `prisma deploy` will throw an error.

### `prisma introspect`

The command `prisma introspect` has been adapted to output the new datamodel format when using if with the `--prototype` flag: 

```
prisma introspect --prototype
```

The command has been improved so that it will pay respect to existing datamodel files. This way you can use it to translate your database schema into a datamodel while the introspection will preserve the ordering of types and fields of your existing datamodel file.

### Common workflows

You can fluently switch between those two commands however you like. For instance you could use `prisma deploy` for most of your migration needs. When you hit an advanced use case where the Prisma migration system is not yet powerful enough, you can:

1. Migrate the database manually 
1. Use `prisma introspect --prototype` to update your datamodel with those changes from the database
1. Use `prisma deploy --no-migrate` to let the Prisma server know about that

## Where should I report bugs?

Please report bugs directly [here](https://github.com/prisma/datamodel-v1.1-for-sql-beta/issues) in this repo!

## What is not part of this beta?

1. [Multi column indexes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3405) are not of this beta yet. We are currently working on implementing them.
2. [Polymorphic relations](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3407) are not part of this beta. We will make a separate effort to implement them.

## FAQ

**How can I migrate my Prisma project with existing data to a new optimised Database schema? E.g. join tables have been removed**

We recommend the following:

1. Use `prisma export` to export the data from your existing Prisma project.
1. Copy your existing Datamodel to a new Prisma project and apply your desired optimisations to your Datamodel.
1. Use `prisma import` to import the data into your new Prisma project.
